
Portals
- Portals teleport entities directly onto their corresponding portal
- Only two portals of a specific colour can exist at any time (as in the Portal games)
- Portals read in as JSON will always come in pairs, solo portals will not be fed in

Player
- There exists a single player on the map at all times

Potions
- Players cannot consume more than one potion a tick (verified???)

Mercenary
- The player requires one coin to bribe them
- The mercenary can be bribed through any entity, as long as they are within range
