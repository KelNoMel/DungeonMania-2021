
Portals
- Portals teleport entities directly onto their corresponding portal
- Only two portals of a specific colour can exist at any time (as in the Portal games)
- Portals read in as JSON will always come in pairs, solo portals will not be fed in


Shield:
- Increase the dividend the player takes damage with

Player
- There exists a single player on the map at all times

Potions
- Players cannot consume more than one potion a tick (verified???)

Mercenary
- The player requires one coin to bribe them
- The mercenary can be bribed through any entity, as long as they are within range

Battles
- A player attacks full force with as many of damage items on every battle they go into. As you don't actually know if an attack will finish the enemy (The Double-tap rule)
- A sword can be used once in a battle and you can't use fist and a sword
- A bow is a weapon that can be used as many extra times as their are bows in the inventory
- An item will deteriorate after x many battles instead of counting by tick as it is possible multiple battles occur in a single tick
