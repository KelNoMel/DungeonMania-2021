
Portals
- Portals teleport entities directly onto their corresponding portal
- Only two portals of a specific colour can exist at any time (as in the Portal games)
- Portals read in as JSON will always come in pairs, solo portals will not be fed in

Shield:
- Deflect x amount damage taken to a player. Rather than removing a % of the damage. Specifically 2 damage in this case.
